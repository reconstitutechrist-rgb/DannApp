## 🔑 Features in Detail

### Dual Chat System
The app intelligently routes your messages:
- **Questions**: "What is useState?" → AI answers
- **Build requests**: "Build a todo app" → AI generates

### Modification System (Phase 2)
Smart diff-based modifications:
- **Simple changes**: Color, text, styling → Auto-applied
- **Medium changes**: New features, dark mode → Auto-applied
- **Complex changes**: Auth, major refactors → Requires approval

### Image Upload
Upload any image and AI will:
- Extract color palette
- Identify design style
- Recreate the aesthetic
- Match fonts and layouts

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Version Control
- `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z` - Redo
- `Ctrl+Y` / `Cmd+Y` - Redo (alternative)

### Interface
- `Enter` - Send message
- `Esc` - Close modals

## 🐛 Known Issues

### ~~Complex Modifications~~ ✅ SOLVED IN PHASE 5
**Update:** Authentication and complex modifications now work reliably via AST operations!

**Try it:** Just say "add authentication" - works automatically in one command.

**What works now:**
- ✅ Complete authentication system (login/logout)
- ✅ State management with hooks
- ✅ Component wrapping and conditional rendering
- ✅ Function injection and JSX modifications

### Token Limits
Very large apps may approach the 16K token limit. **Solution**: Build incrementally through conversation stages.

See [Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more.
